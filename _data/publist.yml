  image: wang1-3080659-large.gif
  description: This article presents a novel continuum robot sheath for use in single-port minimally invasive procedures such as neuroendoscopy in which the sheath is designed to deliver multiple robotic arms. Actuation of the sheath is achieved by using precurved superelastic tubes lining the working channels used for arm delivery.

  image: 1-s2.0-S0022522320305729-gr3_lrg.jpg
  description: We sought to demonstrate in an animal model that helical stents made from a nickel titanium alloy called nitinol (NiTi) and designed for malacic airways could be delivered and removed without significant trauma while minimally impeding mucus clearance during the period of implantation.
