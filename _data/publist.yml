  description: This article presents a novel continuum robot sheath for use in single-port minimally invasive procedures such as neuroendoscopy in which the sheath is designed to deliver multiple robotic arms. Actuation of the sheath is achieved by using precurved superelastic tubes lining the working channels used for arm delivery.
